      <h1>Hello, I’m Veronica—resident of Belleville, Michigan & founder of Bunny’s Balloons</h1>
      <p>
        I’m a wife, mom of two, and a working Mammographer who never lost her love for designing joyful
        spaces. Before the medical world I was a hairstylist, sculpting color and texture every day. That
        creative spark never left, so I revived it through Bunny’s Balloons where I bring a unique blend
        of artistry, empathy, and exactness to every install.
      </p>
      <p>
        My healthcare career taught me how to stay calm, detailed, and compassionate—qualities that guide
        every walkthrough, sketch, and onsite build. Each client is special, and I dedicate my full
        attention to making their celebration truly memorable.

          <h3>Heart-led service</h3>
          <p>
            A medical setting reminds me daily that people deserve gentleness. I bring that same care to
            balloon installs so families, brands, and couples feel fully supported.

          <h3>Creative craftsmanship</h3>
          <p>
            Years in the salon taught me how to design with color, proportion, and consistency. I still
            obsess over tones, textures, and layers so every install feels bespoke.

            organized setup/breakdown plans, and constant communication.
